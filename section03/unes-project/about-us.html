					<strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
					Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took
					a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
					centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
					popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
					more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
					Ipsum.
